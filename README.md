The Williamsburg Coffee Recommender System takes user preferences, such as if they are looking to study, 
if they are able to drive to caf√© locations, allergen info, ideal price point, atmosphere, and coffee drink flavors, 
and returns a local coffee shop recommendation.

The data for this project was collected from 15 different coffee shops in the Williamsburg area.
